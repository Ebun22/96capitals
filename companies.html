        At its core, Social Capital is an organization that identifies hard problems and assembles experts, IP and
        experiments that allow us to learn about these problems deeply. Once we have conviction about a solution, we will then execute — by building,
        buying, or investing in whatever it takes to solve the problem we identified.
        And to better serve the people building these companies, we are building a new kind of organization.
